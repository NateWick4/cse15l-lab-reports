# Welcome New CS15L Student
## How to Connect Remotely!

First we must install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (click the link to download)

Once set up VSCode should look like this ![Image](https://www.infragistics.com/products/indigo-design/help/images/vs-code-extension-drop-down.png)

After checking this we must install [OpenSSH](https://www.infragistics.com/products/indigo-design/help/images/vs-code-extension-drop-down.png) in order to remotely connect to servers with these accounts.

In order to see our CS15L specific account login we must go [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) and lookup our three letter code used to login.

Now in VSCode we can open a new terminal. (Terminal, New Terminal)

First step is to type 
> $ ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu 

but replace zz with the 3 letter code found from earlier. 

Since this is the first time connecting you should see this message 

**The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?**

Say yes to this message.

Once entering your password your terminal should look like
